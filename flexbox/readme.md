# Flexbox

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that allows you to design complex layouts with ease. It provides a more efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.

## Key Concepts
- **Flex Container**: The parent element that holds the flex items. It is defined by setting the `display` property to `flex` or `inline-flex`.
- **Flex Items**: The child elements of a flex container. They are automatically arranged in a row or column based on the flex container's properties.
- **Main Axis**: The primary axis along which flex items are laid out. It can be horizontal (row) or vertical (column).
- **Cross Axis**: The axis perpendicular to the main axis. It is used for alignment and spacing of flex items.
- **Flex Direction**: Sets the direction of the main axis (property: `flex-direction`). It can be set to `row`, `row-reverse`, `column`, or `column-reverse`.
- **Justify Content**: Aligns flex items along the main axis (property: `justify-content`). It can be set to `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, or `space-evenly`.
- **Align Items**: Aligns flex items along the cross axis (property: `align-items`). It can be set to `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`, or `stretch`.
- **Wrap**: Controls whether flex items should wrap onto multiple lines (property: `flex-wrap`). It can be set to `nowrap`, `wrap`, or `wrap-reverse`.
- **Align Content**: Aligns flex items along the cross axis when flex-wrap is set to `wrap` (property: `align-content`). It can be set to `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, or `stretch`.
